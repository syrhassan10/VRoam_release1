Health Tips & Suggestions:

\- Reduce calories intake by at least 500, but no more than 1000.

\- There are around 3500 calories in a pound of stored body fat.

\- On average, every pound of the human body consists of 75% fat and 25% lean tissue.

\- Calorie loss can be achieved by working out, reduced consumption, or a combination of both!

\- The ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine) recommends a minimum calorie consumption of 1200 for females and 1800 for males. It’s great to want to lose weight but stay healthy while you’re at it!

\- 1 MET is approximately 3.5 mL of oxygen consumed per kilogram of body weight every minute; therefore proper breathing is important!

Every minute, your body’s burning calories just to keep you alive! This is known as your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).

***Disclaimer: All calculations are estimates and approximations, not accurate data.\***

Meeting Points:

\-     Two separate guides (Trainer and Tour Guide).

\-     Tour Guide will maintain a physical presence and act as an NPC to introduce and guide the player to areas of the map.

\-     Brief introductions and stories to interesting elements.

\-     Trainer will be an AI tracker on the side of the screen.

\-     Trainer takes in physical and outputs health data.

\-     Simulation corresponding to in game units.

 

Trainer

\-     Possible inputs (can have pre-sets): age, gender, weight, height, ethnicity, health conditions (diseases), disabilities, health goals, eating habits.

\-     Possible outputs: calories, distance, time, percentage towards health goal, modified eating habits (tips).

Calculations:

\-     Male BMR = 66 + (13.7 x weight in kilos) + (5 x height in cm) – (6.8 x age in years)

\-     Female BMR = 655 + (9.6 X weight in kilos) + (1.8 X height in cm) – (4.7 x age in years).

\-     Total daily calories (INTAKE) base on exercise level:

a)   Sedentary – Little or no exercise = BMR * 1.2

b)   Lightly Active – Light sports/exercise 1-3 days/week = BMR * 1.375

c)   Moderately Active – Moderate sports/exercise 3-5 days/week = BMR * 1.55

d)   Very Active – Hard sports/exercise 6-7 days/week = BMR * 1.725

e)   Extra Active – Very hard/professional, physically demanding job, training twice or more per day = BMR * 1.9

**Speed (km/h) to MET: f(x) = 2.5557e^0.1266x**

**Calories/minute = MET \* 3.5 \* (body weight kilos) / 200**

Game Foundations:

\-     The AHA recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic (long duration) exercise each week for optimal cardiovascular health.

\-     That’s equal to 500 MET minutes per week.

\-     Need to burn about 3,500 calories to lose 1 pound of body weight.

\-     Healthy weight loss is 0.5 - 1 kg per week.

Notes:

\-      

 

Health Tips & Suggestions:

\-     Reduce calories intake by at least 500, but no more than 1000.

\-     There are around 3500 calories in a pound of stored body fat.

\-     On average, every pound of the human body consists of 75% fat and 25% lean tissue.

\-     Calorie loss can be achieved by working out, reduced consumption, or a combination of both!

\-     The ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine) recommends a minimum calorie consumption of 1200 for females and 1800 for males. It’s great to want to lose weight but stay healthy while you’re at it!

\-     1 MET is approximately 3.5 mL of oxygen consumed per kilogram of body weight every minute; therefore proper breathing is important!

\-     Every minute, your body’s burning calories just to keep you alive! This is known as your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).     

\-     Weight loss isn’t linear, it’s extremely chaotic, so don’t assume you’re failing if you don’t see constant progress.

\-     Weight loss is exponential and chaotic.

\-     Fat loss doesn’t equate directly to weight loss, different water retention as well as full bowels may affect your results!

\-     Make fat loss a lifestyle, not a result.

\-     Exercise everyday to maintain your weight loss results.

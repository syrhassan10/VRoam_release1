**Ideas:**

\-     UI requires Distance Traveled, Current Speed, Calories Burned, Progress to milestone.

a.    Progress to milestone can be a vertical bar to the side

b.   UI can be customizable (later).

c.    UI shouldnâ€™t change too fast, perhaps update once per second.

d.   Priority: Calories > Distance Traveled = Current Speed

**Plans:**
